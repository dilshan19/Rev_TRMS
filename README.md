# Rev_TRMS

Project 1 of Revature's training program in cojunction with batch mate Brian M.
This webapp utilizes:
-HTML, CSS, JS, AJAX
-Java Servlets
-JUnit, Log4j
-Postgres 11 DB

The purpose of this application is to build a site where two types of users - requestors and non-requestors
can interact to agree upon a reimbursement request. An requestor can submit a reimbursement form for approval by
3 different kinds of non-requestors. Upon receiving all the appropriate acceptances, the requestor will be able 
to view their updated request as accepted.

This project is meant as an introduction to full stack development. Improvements for future projects will include
increased abstraction through the use of Hibernate class mapping and an Angular front end. Stay tuned.
